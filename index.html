      <h3>Project 1</h3>
      <p>In this project I did a thing. In fact i did multiple things. Those things were an amalgamation of more things that overall became one finished thing. Now I didn't know what else to write so here is some lyrics:</p>
      If you had one shot, or one opportunity.
      To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
      Would you capture it
      Or just let it slip? Yo
      His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
      There’s vomit on his sweater already, mom’s spaghetti
      He’s nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
      To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin’
      What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
      He opens his mouth, but the words won’t come out
      He’s chokin’, how, everybody’s jokin’ now
      The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
      Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
      Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
      He’s so mad, but he won’t give up that easy? No
      He won’t have it, he knows his whole back’s to these ropes
      It don’t matter, he’s dope, he knows that, but he’s broke
      He’s so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that’s when it’s
      Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody Better go capture this moment and hope it don’t pass him.

      Making my way downtown
      Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
      Staring blankly ahead
      Just making my way
      Making a way through the crowd
      And I need you
      And I miss you
      And now I wonder
      If I could fall into the sky
      Do you think time would pass me by?
      'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
      If I could just see you tonight
      It's always times like these when I think of you
      And wonder if you ever think of me
      'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong
      Living in your precious memory
      'Cause I need you
      And I miss you
      And now I wonder
      If I could fall into the sky
      Do you think time would pass me by?
      Oh, 'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
      If I could just see you tonight
      And I, I don't wanna let you know
      I, I drown in your memory
      I, I don't wanna let this go
      I, I don't
      Making my way downtown
      Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
      Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
      Making a way through the crowd.

   <p>In this project I did a thing. In fact i did mutliple things. Those things were an amalgamation of more things that overall became one finished thing. Now I didn't know what else to write so here is some lyrics:</p>
   Ladies up in here tonight
   No fighting
   We got the refugees up in here
   No fighting, no fighting
   Shakira, Shakira
   I never really knew that she could dance like this
   She make a man wanna speak Spanish
   ¿Cómo se llama (sí), bonita (sí), mi casa (sí, Shakira Shakira), su casa
   Oh baby when you talk like that
   You make a woman go mad
   So be wise (Sí!) and keep on (Sí!)
   Reading the signs of my body
   I'm on tonight
   You know my hips don't lie (no fighting)
   And I'm starting to feel it's right
   All the attraction, the tension
   Don't you see, baby, this is perfection?
   Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
   And it's driving me crazy
   And I didn't have the slightest idea
   Until I saw you dancing (yeah)
   And when you walk up on the dance floor
   Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl (just move)
   And everything so unexpected, the way you right and left it
   So you can keep on shaking it (let's go)
   I never really knew that she could dance like this
   She make a man wants to speak Spanish
  ¿Cómo se llama? (Sí), bonita (sí)
  Mi casa, su casa.
